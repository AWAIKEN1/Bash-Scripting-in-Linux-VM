# Bash Scripting Practice on a Linux VM

## Overview
This repository documents my journey in practicing Bash scripting on a Linux virtual machine. As part of my learning process, I am creating and executing various scripts

## Server Health Check Script

### Description
The server health check script is a Bash script designed to assess and report on various aspects of a Linux server's performance. This includes CPU load, memory usage, disk space, and more. The script is part of my larger effort to enhance my skills in Bash scripting and Linux system administration.

### Features
- **CPU Load Check**: Reports the 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute load averages.
- **Memory Usage Check**: Displays the total, used, and free memory.
- More features to be added as I progress in my learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Access to a Linux server or a virtual machine where Bash scripts can be executed.
- Appropriate permissions to execute and test scripts on the server.

### Installing and Usage
1. Clone this repository to your Linux environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Make the server health check script executable:
   ```bash 
   chomod +x server_health_check.sh
   ```
4. Execute the script to check the server's health:
   ```bash
   ./server_health_check.sh
   ```

## Learning Journey
This repository is part of my ongoing learning journey in Linux system administration and Bash scripting. As I continue to learn and experiment, I will update this repository with new scripts and enhancements to existing ones.
